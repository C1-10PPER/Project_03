The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive data visualization of global climate change and its overall impact. To conduct this analysis, we first gathered data from the International Monetary Fund and the World Health Organization, compiling a dataset that includes temperature changes, COâ‚‚ emissions, sea level variations, climate-related disasters, and pollution-related illnesses.

After assembling our datasets, we utilized JavaScript to develop interactive visualizations that illustrate trends in global climate change over time. This site showcases these visualizations, along with detailed explanations and insights into significant patterns and trends observed in the data.


Ethical Considerations

For our project, we only used open sourced publicly available data sets from reputable organizations to compile data for our project. Facts are not considered original and therefore may not be copyrighted. We also did not use any personal identifying information for our project. The data is broad in scope and represents the full population and does not specify racial backgrounds.
