                    The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive data visualization of global climate change and its overall impact. 
                    To conduct this analysis, we first gathered data from the International Monetary Fund and the World Health Organization, 
                    compiling a dataset that includes temperature changes, COâ‚‚ emissions, sea level variations, climate-related disasters, 
                    and pollution-related illnesses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After assembling our datasets, we utilized JavaScript to develop interactive visualizations that illustrate trends in 
                    global climate change over time. This site showcases these visualizations, along with detailed explanations and insights 
                    into significant patterns and trends observed in the data.
